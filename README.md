# [Aether](https://phoque52.github.io/aether/anasayfa.html)

**Aether** is a speech-based AI model developed to support the 8th Grade "Revolution History and Kemalism" course.

## How Does It Work?

Aether is a project developed using HTML and CSS for the front-end, and Dialogflow and JavaScript for the back-end. The website is hosted via GitHub Pages.  
Rather than functioning as a traditional AI, Aether is designed as a comprehensive question-and-answer system.

When users ask a question, Aether can only respond if the developers have previously defined an answer for that specific query. The system operates on this principle.  
Aether's knowledge base is expanded and updated regularly by the development team.  
If the system cannot answer a question, it likely means that the information has not yet been added to the response database.

## Environmentally Conscious Infrastructure

The team behind Aether is mindful of the environmental impact caused by the high energy consumption of AI systems. Therefore, optimized infrastructures were prioritized during the development and hosting of the project:

- The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.  
- Question-and-answer data is processed through Dialogflow.  

Our goal is not just to build a functional system but to do so without harming nature.  
Aether believes in using technology responsibly.
